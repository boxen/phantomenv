## Credits

This library was heavily, heavily, heavily inspired by
[@sstephenson](https://github.com/sstephenson)'s
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and
[ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) projects.
A few ideas were also taken from [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

A number of patterns and utilities are borrowed from that project,
and it is my hope that phantomenv provides the same simplicity,
elegance, and usability that I've come to love in rbenv and ruby-build
for PhantomJS users.
